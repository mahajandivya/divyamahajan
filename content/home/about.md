# Biography

Divya Mahajan is a PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department at [Georgia Institute of Technology] (https://www.gatech.edu/) where she is advised by Professor [Hadi Esmaeilzadeh](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hadi/). She received her Bachelors (2012) in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Ropar](www.iitrpr.ac.in/), India where she was honored with the President of India Gold medal for her outstanding academic performance. Subsequently, she completed her Masters (2014) from the [University of Texas, at Austin] (https://www.utexas.edu) in Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

She joined her PhD studies in Fall 2014 and since has been a part of [Alternate Computing Technologies lab](http://act-lab.org). Her research interests include computer architecture, microarchitecture design, and developing alternative technologies for efficient computing. She is continuously working towards designing full stack solutions and template-based architectures for accelerating Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms on an FPGA. Besides her primary research-area of computer architecture, she has also worked at the intersection of machine learning, hardware design, programming languages and databases.
